and      ,know   its    resulting length      in           advance, 
ethen     nalso  ouse   an        appropriate constructor, this     is        much       more efficient
because   it     means  that      only        one          time-    consuming allocation 
takes     place, and    no        unnecessary copying      of       data.     
Nonsense: of     course the       above       code         is       more      efficient.
